# PIP-3

### Introduction
**PIP-3** is one of two student projects accounting to the final mark of this years (2025) grade in programming beginning from the 21st of January until the 28th of February.

The center of attention of this project lies within developing a functional multiplayer game using Unity with either a Client-Server or Peer-to-Peer communication.

The project aims to provide students with hands-on experience in networked game development, covering essential aspects such as state synchronization, latency handling, and real-time multiplayer interactions. This technical challenge will help develop crucial skills in both game development and network programming.

### Gameplay
**PIP 3** features a character selection of X characters with individual abilities and thought out physics and movement.

**PIP 3** has been inspired by *nidhogg* and supports a similar mechanic, reaching the end of the opposing site to win the game.

With the characters having individual abilities with high cooldowns **PIP 3** offers a deep strategy to outplay your opponent and claim the win. 
Besides that the game also offers a combat weapon at the beginning of the game to chose from, with which the set player will respawn each time if defeated or eliminated.

### Art Style
The game features a 2.5D look to complement its mechanics and gameplay to save time and work for animations during this short period of time.
