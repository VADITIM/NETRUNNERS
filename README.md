# PIP-3

## Introduction
**PIP-3** is one of two student projects accounting to the final mark of this years (2025) grade in programming beginning from the 21st of January until the 28th of February.

The center of attention of this project lies within developing a functional multiplayer game using Unity with either a Client-Server or Peer-to-Peer communication.

The project aims to provide students with hands-on experience in networked game development, covering essential aspects such as state synchronization, latency handling, and real-time multiplayer interactions. This technical challenge will help develop crucial skills in both game development and network programming.

## Gameplay
**PIP 3** features a character selection of X characters with individual abilities and thought out physics and movement.

**PIP 3** has been inspired by *nidhogg* and supports a similar mechanic, reaching the end of the opposing site to win the game.

With the characters having individual abilities with high cooldowns **PIP 3** offers a deep strategy to outplay your opponent and claim the win. 
Besides that the game also offers a combat weapon at the beginning of the game to chose from, with which the set player will respawn each time if defeated or eliminated.

### **Individual Weapons**

Before the game begins, both players select one weapon from three options in a provided selection.

This weapon serves as the player's primary method of attack and defense, used to prevent opponents from reaching the end goal.

Each weapon can be thrown, depleted, or broken through special interactions.

For example, a gun offers incredible range but limited ammunition, a sword provides high durability but minimal reach, and a spear can be picked up multiple times despite being fragile in close combat.

The weapon selection system adds both replayability and strategic depth to the game, especially when drawing from a larger pool of randomly assigned weapons before each match.

### **Character-Specific Abilities**

Beyond weapon selection, players can choose unique characters. Each character has two powerful abilities with long cooldowns of 60-120 seconds. These abilities are not meant to be used a maximum of two times per match due to its fast pace.

These abilities pack significant power, enabling dramatic comebacks when players face major disadvantages. Examples include freezing opponents temporarily, firing a devastating laser beam, or distorting the opponent's screen similar to Mario Kart's squid effect.

However, these abilities shouldn't serve as automatic get out of jail mechanisms.

### Environment

The environment should not consist merely of platforms and terrain. It will include *deadly traps and interactive elements*, such as a button that, when pressed, causes a box to fall, platforms that move, or ones that vanish upon contact.

What remains controversial in terms of the game’s pacing is the *Merchant*. Whether this NPC will be introduced at all is still undecided. The Merchant’s role is to serve as a kind of NPC that appears randomly with a low probability. Players who accept his offer will be both cursed and blessed.

The curse might involve something like a larger hitbox, reduced movement speed, or other drawbacks. On the other hand, the blessing could grant benefits such as an extra charge for abilities, increased jump power, or similar advantages.

Additionally, there should be an item akin to the *Smash Bros. smash ball*. Its primary function would simply be to recharge abilities.

## Art Style
The game features a visually appealing 2.5D aesthetic that strategically balances visual depth with practical implementation.

This artistic choice not only complements the core mechanics and gameplay elements effectively, but also allows for efficient development and streamlined animation processes during the project's condensed timeline.

The 2.5D perspective creates an engaging visual experience while maintaining a manageable scope for asset creation and character movement implementation.
